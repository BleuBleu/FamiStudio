# FFmpeg Download

Here are some download links for ffmpeg. If you are a more advanced user, feel free to get a more recent version, these links are simply here for convenience. Whatever you do, **be sure to download the GPL version**.

Both of these website offer nightly builds (their usually have weird numbers in the name) and stable builds (with nice version number like '4.3.1'). Stable versions are recommended.

* [Windows](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/) : Download recent stable version with "win64-gpl-shared" in the name. 
* [MacOS](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/) : Download the stable version on the right side.

On Linux, simply use your favorite package manager. You should be able to figure it out.
