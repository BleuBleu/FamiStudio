4.3.0
=====
- Support for custom tuning (ex: where A is not 440Hz).
- N163 auto position assignment

4.3.0 Testing
=============
- Test detuning with sound, dual NSF, slide notes, etc.
- Test potential threading issues with N163 auto-assignment.

- UI code cleanup:
	- Project explorer rewrite
		- Convert all x,y to points.
		- Test double click behavior on mobile.
		- Test scroll bars a lot more. 
			- Scroll bar doesnt goo all the way down if you click in the empty part.
		- Middle mouse panning (when i get a mouse...)
		- Mobile stuff : white outlines, flings, touch, etc.
			x Icons are too small in PE, or not spaced correctly? Take screenshots of current version.
			x Top tabs take space even tho they arent there.
			/ Implement "touch-as-mouse" functionality on controls.
			x SLiders are a bit thicker now
			x Left margin too big, right one too small.
			x Check in checkboxes too small, not centered.
			- Draggin env on itself ask wrong instrument? Try in roar.
			x We should be able to long press on the label of a param to reset the value.
			- Apply our recipe for insturment everywhere.
	x Toolbar rewrite
	- Try merging all sln/projects in 1 now that we are all .NET
		- If that works, try creating a "Win64AsMobile" build.
	- Add support for more international characeters, switch to Noto.
	- To test : 
		- Dialog ticks
		- Toast tick
		- We ficed a double-tick issue in 4.2.1 i think, make sure that's included.
- Support for japanese/other characters regardless of current languages
	- Switch all UI to Noto Sans?
	- Have a series of fallback fonts when searching for a glyph.
- FUTURE : Android convert to our widgets, no more android native widgets.

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Backlog: 
=========
- NSF/FS comparison bugs:
	- N163 : Sound OK, but gets out of phase at the first slide note and remains like that. This is normal, this is due to slide notes not being able to be approximated correctly with fine pitch. 
	- VRC7 : Very slight pitch issue due to pitch shift (3) used on VRC7 and how we look for best matching note.
	- FT Tempo : The slides are too fast in NSF almost all channels.
- Project cleanup : organize insturments/folders by expansion
- Android media player notification option
- Allow changing vibrato depth without resetting (vibrato speed will still reset for the time being)
	- Dont compress vibrato envelopes.
	- New opcode "override envelope and reset", call only when speed changes.
- Kawashin N163 comparison with NSFPLAY, listen to Wave 1 isolated. (https://discord.com/channels/@me/1093046594062004286/1183464431674470570)
- BUG : Why does Mesen play NSF ~0.3% to ~0.4% faster than us? Export a wav and compare. Affects both ROM and NSF.
- Paste FX values from text. Kain wanted to change DAC slowly, had values to paste. 
- Simple parameters for instruments (duty, volume)
- Export selection. 
	https://discord.com/channels/@me/819772561940152321/1202138717054304306
- Wome kind of warning if multiple VRC7 patch-0 instrument overlaps?
- Can we keep undo/redo buttons on screen to 1280px? Like hide metronome, etc.
- A way to view the preview effect value (grey rectangle). Either draw it on the left edge, or in the piano roll tolltip.
	https://discord.com/channels/@me/819772561940152321/1157075515199475732
- Bug import N163 instruments
	https://discord.com/channels/@me/819772561940152321/1154660603617607741
- Low slide notes going down + arp going up = glitch. Fix idea : Internally modify the arp to make it less strong based on slide range (ex: div by 4 if doing down 2 octaves).

- Android encoder bitrate is messed up.
- When multiple VRC7 instrument all use patch 0 at same time (like on first note), they all upload it. Its stupid. Only the first one should, or something like that.
- OSC trigger assert 
- Option to keep unused samples when exporting to sound engine. 
	=> Shelved, will need more work.
- How to add to the "open with" list on Android.
- Better autosave names?
- Delete instruments resets play head.
- Export DMC samples on Mobile.
- Option to set snapping auto depending on last resize.
- "Read only" N163 instrument. Just specify RAM position + size. Other instruments will do the writing.
- NSF import issue TF74
- FDS oscilloscope can assert if you use modulation table to produce very low sound.
- Fix "SeparateChannelsExportTndMode"
- Dual APU (VT02) support? Mesen doesnt support it, fuck it. 
- S5B is 1 octave off. Periods are 12 bits, so technically can do lower, but we still bottom at A0???
- Shy mode on mobile?
- BUG : Quit menu does nothing on MacOS
- Weird shift when using an external display with different scaling (ex: 100% vs 150%)
- Add effect to select N163 wave. How does it react in FT.
- Full range volume for expansions?
- Different aspect ratios for video export? Somebody asked for square
- Improve linux file dialog (Steo feedback)
- Idea from perkka "When an instrument is selected. Have the channels thats not supported by it slightly faded out, or the channel names that support it in bold or something"
- Do a pass on tooltips for ParamProviders.
- Left resize to preserve release position?
- Display number of selected channels in grid for video export?
- BUG : Drag single pattern (with one note covring the entire pattern) from 1 channel to the other while its playing, the old note keeps playing and adds on top.
- BUG : "theres a bug where when you select a pattern multiple times and you try to change a note, the change is multiplied by the # of patterns you selected", see video.
- Reorder channels for video export.
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Sound output selection?
- Give better names to auto saves
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value. How to fix???
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- Uncompressed envelopes
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHĀKRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Dont reset camera in piano roll when deleting instrument (probably to handle case where you were editing the instrument)
- Length counter support? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg8B3kiVckY
- Double-click to edit name of instrument
- Way to tell if a pattern has other instances, like highlight all instances when mouse over? 
- There is no vertical scaling in effect. Vertical scaling is done with piano, there is no piano.

- Option to remove high-pitch from triangle. Mesen has an option, but that's now what we need. I think how2B wants more filtering. Filtering options per channel type?
	https://discord.com/channels/@me/819772561940152321/1187597131859636276
