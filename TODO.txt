4.1.0
=====
- BUG : DPCM wave noteTooltip "123 samples selected" is clipped when scrollbars are enabled.
- BUG : Preview DPCM affects volume triangle
- BUG : play -> pause and i hear something strange
	=> Cant repro. Mac only?
- Better autosave names?
Linux:
- Tromino, key issues. https://discord.com/channels/747649221879922840/747649222354010173/1060127173006069820
	=> NO REPRO
Android stuff:
- GLTODO, CTRLTODO, NSFTODO, NET5TODO, MATTT, etc. Review all those.

Testing
=======
- All ROM exports, FDS too (make sure we give nice error msg for too much DPCM).
- Test all widgets with and without scrollbars. With pink lines, check everything.
- FT2 NSF
- Multiple songs in NSF with the new layout.
- Run unit test for DPCM
- Test DPCM w/ multi
- Recompile/re-export sound engine demo roms. Bump version. (no DPCM bank switching here)
- Retest DPI scaling A LOT.
- Re-export all ROM songs at the end.
- Re-export all ROM test (.bin) files at the end.
- Sample, instrument and song import (all places where we switched to OpenProjectAsync)
- Test videos a lot, compare colors. Cancel in middle w/ DPI scaling to see if everything continues OK.
- Test numeric up/down on android with increment. 

Packaging
=========
- Add "description" HTML metadata to famistudio doc.
- Preset instruments
- Add temple raiders demo song (MMC5)
- Recompile ROMs, re-export data, bump versions, etc.
- Uncheck x86 in supported android platforms.
- MacOS install doesnt work if dotnet is missing? I thought that was fixed.

Android SDK 12
==============
- Java path : C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-11.0.12.7-hotspot

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"

	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Convert PNG to TGA
==================
"c:\Program Files\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q8\magick.exe" mogrify -path D:\Dump\Icons\Out\Tga -compress RLE -format tga *.png

Android Notes

Backlog: 
=========
- Finish phase reset support
- Going in settings unutes all channels.
- Delete instruments resets play head.
- We should be able to drag/copy samples mappings between instruments.
- Export DMC samples on Mobile.
- Option to set snapping auto depending on last resize.
- "Read only" N163 instrument. Just specify RAM position + size. Other instruments will do the writing.
- NSF import issue TF74
- FDS oscilloscope can assert if you use modulation table to produce very low sound.
- Fix "SeparateChannelsExportTndMode"
- Dual APU (VT02) support? Mesen doesnt support it, fuck it. 
- S5B is 1 octave off. Periods are 12 bits, so technically can do lower, but we still bottom at A0???
- Shy mode on mobile?
- BUG : Quit menu does nothing on MacOS
- Weird shift when using an external display with different scaling (ex: 100% vs 150%)
- Add effect to select N163 wave. How does it react in FT.
- Full range volume for expansions?
- Different aspect ratios for video export?
- Improve linux file dialog (Steo feedback)
- Hold SHIFT+click for multiple delete.
- Idea from perkka "When an instrument is selected. Have the channels thats not supported by it slightly faded out, or the channel names that support it in bold or something"
- Do a pass on tooltips for ParamProviders.
- Left resize to preserve release position?
- Display number of selected channels in grid for video export?
- BUG : Drag single pattern (with one note covring the entire pattern) from 1 channel to the other while its playing, the old note keeps playing and adds on top.
- BUG : "theres a bug where when you select a pattern multiple times and you try to change a note, the change is multiplied by the # of patterns you selected", see video.
- Reorder channels for video export.
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sound output selection?
- Give better names to auto saves
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value. How to fix???
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- ffmpeg path on Linux should work on path (Puna on CC discord).
- Uncompressed envelopes
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- C0 is hidden in piano roll video
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHĀKRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Dont reset camera in piano roll when deleting instrument (probably to handle case where you were editing the instrument)
- Improve no-attack.
	- Allow disabling attacks if all envelopes of both instruments are exactly the same.
	- Draw attack as red if user makes a mistake.
- Wayland support on Linux (GLFW supports it). Standard file dialogs.
