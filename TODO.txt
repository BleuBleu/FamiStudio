3.2.1
=====
x Option to disable vibration.
x 8/24 bits wave files.
x Too zoomed in in envelope editor
x Effect panel vs. snapping.
x Text export broken?	
x Draw note attacks for ghost notes?
x DPCM dont play if seek bar is example on them.
x NSF issue from how2.
x Stereo export VS. TND?
	=> Test a bit more.
- "Seems some parameters on the instrument settings on the app take several taps to change", "The FM presets for sure"
	=> Hitbox is too small.
- Update doc for mobile.
	=> Undocumented INI params.
- Integrity asserts in Glisten.
x zaxolotl, NSF

3.3.0
=====
- Right-click functionality.
- Rewrite that crazy ugly function in sound engine + figure out how to have more  (change volume or double-special code for rare ones).
- Option to override DMC initial value on sample mapping.
- Improve oscilloscope stability (min square norm?)
- Fix GTK leak (GTK 3.x?), or 2.12.45
- Uncompressed envelopes
- Improve no-attack.
- Register viewer.
- Volume/effect scaling
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHĀKRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Way to temporarely disable snapping (FL studio does it with ALT).
- Volume/effect scaling?
- Improve snapping.

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile the MacLauncher with this to link to the AppKit version that
  matches GTK+2. This will make MacOS load these older versions afterwards,
  even on more recent OS'es.
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
	cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
	cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"

	cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"

	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

- Hue: -180
- Chroma: -20

Backlog: 
=========
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- ROM export with expansion?
- More options for oscilloscope (https://github.com/maxim-zhao/SidWizPlus/wiki)
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- NSF import read DMC initial value.
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
